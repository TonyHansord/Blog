#Academy Xi SE Week 3/Phase 0 Project Review

This week was mostly about completing my personal portfolio project, as we only had a brief class on Tuesday about column layouts in CSS. Some other things that we needed to go through on the Canvas portal were some css properties. I had already done these labs and watched the videos a couple weeks ago, Ill mention some of the things that I learned and try to tie it to my project so theres a real example of how its used.

##CSS Properties

CSS positioning is a very important part of web development. There are many different ways to position elements on a page. The most common ways are static, relative, absolute, and fixed. Static is the default positioning of an element.

Relative is a positioning that is relative to the normal position of the element.

Absolute is a positioning that is relative to the first positioned parent element.

I used absolute positioning for my nav dropdown menu. I wanted the menu to be positioned relative to the nav bar.

Fixed is a positioning that is relative to the viewport. So basilcally it stays in the same place no matter where you scroll. I used this to keep my navigation bar at the top of the page.

Z-index is a property that allows you to control the stacking order of elements. The higher the z-index, the closer the element is to the front. i used this for the toggle button for the nav menu, as well as the nav menu itself.

Margin and padding are properties that allow you to control the spacing around elements. Margin is the spacing outside of the element, and padding is the spacing inside of the element. Pretty much every element on the page has padding. I find its a good idea to set the padding to 0 for all elements, and then add padding to the elements that you want to have padding.

Display is a property that allows you to control how an element is displayed. The most common values are block, inline, and inline-block, but I am very fond of using flex and grid although its more of a recent addition compared to the others.

## Project Review

Next week we have no live sessions, to allow students to complete their assigment. As you can see i have completed mine already and will use the time to read up on the next content and work on some personal practice projects, which will help me in further stages of the course.
